Finally, we have decided to go open, after lots of work and research, AqLeds is ready,
and it's free (as in freedom). We're publishing it under the GPL license for everything:

* The [mainboard hardware][hardware_main] and the 
  [modular led lamps hardware][hardware_lamp], built on [kicad-pcb][kicad]
* The [firmware][firmware], written in C
* The [PC software][pc], written in Qt C++, to setup your AqLeds.
