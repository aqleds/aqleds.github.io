AqLeds is a project started by Alvaro Atencia, and Miguel Ángel Ajo.
We are both passionate about technology and nature, Alvaro specially
passionate about aquarism, and Miguel Ángel about engineering.

Alvaro had started some experiments on LED lighting for aquarium plants, with
very good results on properly chosen leds, and he had started an online LED
lighting shop. At that time, I was running my little enginering company (NBEE),
and we decided to run a joint venture to start this project.

A venture for what?, well, for AqLeds, we wanted something programmable and
open, which allowed for natural light cycles on the plants, using almost 
any kind of LED lamps available in the market (we even designed a set of 
modular lamps), proprietary solutions 
locked you into expensive LED lamps, and also were either quite expensive, 
or crappy designed.

Things turned to go slower than we wanted, we had one prototype which is still
running on Alvaro's aquariums, it had a fancy OLED screen, an aluminium box
design, a capacitive touch control front panel. It worked very well, but
it was a bit over engineered, and when we looked into the manufacturing budget,
it was too high. So we took an step back, no OLED, no aluminium box, no touch screen, something simple, still delivering the power we wanted.

And this is where we are, an opensource 3 channel LED controller, capable
of smothly delivering 100W per channel during 'sunrise', 'day', 'sunset', 
and 'night'

We chose to open the project, because we really believe, that all together
we can do it better, there are many things we can do yet:

* Longitude / Latitude tracking for lighting.
* Plant cycle induction
* Open API to make any other use via USB.
